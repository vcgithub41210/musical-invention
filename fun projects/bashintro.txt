echo is a command to display the contents passed as arguement
cat is a command used to print the contents of a file
Here are some basic linux commands and bash scripting information

bash is an environment provided to run files and executables
to create a shell file we can use the touch command and specify the name of the file followed by a ".sh" extension
once you create a shell file you can then open it and edit the file
once edited the file, you can make it into an executable by using the chmod command

chmod command is used to bring modifications to a file to allow permissions to write read or execute to different users.
The different users are:
the owner (u),
the file group (g),
the people that are neither part of the file group nor the owner called others (o)

  }
the permissions include read(r),write(w),execute(x)}
the persmissions can be provided by using the + operand or removed from a user by using the - operand
eg: chmod o-w file.txt ==> removes(-) the permission to write(w) into file.txt from the others (o)
eg: chmod u+rx file.txt ==> provides(+) the permission to read(r) and execute(x) file.txt to the owner(u)

Thus using the chmod command, we can make the shell file into an executable by typing the command: chmod +x filename.sh
this converts the .sh file into a executable and then by simply typing the command: ./filename.sh ==> we can execute the file
